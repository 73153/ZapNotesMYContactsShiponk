The initial view we will limit to 5 swipes.&nbsp;<br><br>Certain modules, as you will see, will contain more than one piece of content, these should be swipable and limited to 5 pieces of content. These should all just be in order so there shouldn't be a need to have to select which will be present.<br><br>I have provided 2 versions of each screen, horizontal and vertical.<br><br>When you enter a topic or channel the same should apply, a swipe across to view more content, but this shouldn't be limited by pages and the number of pages will be dictated by the amount of content.<br><br>I want to use the same image across all elements, so I will only ever one image uploaded. The app should show the image at a smaller version if square, and show a relevant sized segment of a smaller version if not square. As you will see in the screen 2 psd, the images are generally square with the white box on top of the image with the copy in it, rather than a rectangular image. Any thumbnails would also use this image.<br><br>The menu structure needs to be restyled to fit in with the device, this currently just looks too stretched.<br><br>Any module which has text over an should have an opaque layer over it to ensure the text is readable.<br><br>The related articles should feature as per screenshot 4<br><br>Again, we will be looking for linkedin sign in so the signin screen to be as per the phone version.<br><br>Again, I urge you to download the Mckinsey app off the iTunes store as you will be able to see the bulk of this in action in terms of what we are looking to create.
